# DemandForecaster

DemandForecaster is a project designed to analyze and predict product demand using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on providing accurate demand forecasts to assist in inventory management and business decision-making.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/Product_Demand.ipynb**: Thid Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and demand forecasting model implementation.
- **notebook/Product_demand_retail.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and deamand forecasting model implementation for Retail Stores.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization.
- Machine learning-based demand forecasting.
- Insights to optimize inventory and reduce overstock/understock scenarios.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries (install via `requirements.txt` if available):
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- scikit-learn
    - tensorflow
